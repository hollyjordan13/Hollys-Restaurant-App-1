## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, an app with little functionality was incrementally converted into a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. It takes a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was also be added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

The project is available on GitHub, titled [Hollys-Restaurant-App-1](https://github.com/hollyjordan13/Hollys-Restaurant-App-1.git).

## Specifications

The code for a restaurant reviews website was provided. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. 

The code has been updated with accessibility features, including aria labels and tab indexes. An interactive map using MapBox's map API was incorporated. CSS and HTML was updated to give the app a responsive design across multiple devices. And finally a service worker was registered to provide a better offline experience.


## Instructions

1. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
